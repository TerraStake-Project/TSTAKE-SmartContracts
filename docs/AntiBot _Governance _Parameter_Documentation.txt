AntiBot Governance Parameter Documentation

This documentation provides detailed information about all configurable parameters in the AntiBot contract to help governance participants make informed decisions.
 *Core Protection Parameters
Transaction Throttling
Parameter	Description	Current Value	Impact
blockThreshold	Base number of blocks between transactions	1	Higher values increase delay between transactions. Each increment adds ~12 seconds of delay.
baseMultiplier	Base multiplier for throttling calculation	12	Directly influences cooldown duration. A value of 12 means ~2-3 minutes cooldown.
rapidTransactionThreshold	Number of transactions before triggering progressive throttling	5	Lower values activate throttling sooner. Should be between 3-10 for effective protection.
rapidTransactionWindow	Time window for monitoring rapid transactions	5 minutes	Longer windows increase detection sensitivity. Recommended between 3-15 minutes.
maxMultiplier	Maximum throttling multiplier	60	Caps maximum cooldown to prevent permanent lockouts. 60 equals ~12 minutes maximum cooldown.
Governance Considerations:

    Reducing blockThreshold below 1 effectively disables basic throttling
    baseMultiplier × blockThreshold = seconds of throttling at minimum level
    During attack vectors, cooldown can reach up to maxMultiplier × blockThreshold seconds

*Price Circuit Breakers
Parameter	Description	Current Value	Impact
priceImpactThreshold	Price drop % to trigger buyback pause	5%	Lower values increase sensitivity to price drops. Range: 1-10% recommended.
circuitBreakerThreshold	Price drop % to trigger full circuit breaker	15%	Should be significantly higher than priceImpactThreshold. Range: 10-25% recommended.
priceSurgeThreshold	Price increase % to trigger surge protection	10%	Controls sensitivity to price manipulation. Range: 5-20% recommended.
surgeCooldownPeriod	Duration surge protection remains active	30 minutes	Longer periods provide more protection against price manipulation attacks.
priceCheckCooldown	Minimum time between price checks	5 minutes	Balance between update frequency and gas costs. Should be 3-10 minutes.
Governance Considerations:

    Circuit breaker thresholds must maintain: circuitBreakerThreshold > priceImpactThreshold
    Lower thresholds provide more protection but may trigger more frequently during normal volatility
    Higher thresholds reduce false positives but may be less effective against rapid attacks

Liquidity Protection
Parameter	Description	Current Value	Impact
liquidityLockPeriod	Time liquidity providers must wait before withdrawing	1 hour	Longer periods protect against rug pulls but reduce liquidity flexibility.
Governance Considerations:

    During extreme volatility, consider increasing this value to 12-24 hours
    During stable market conditions, can be reduced to 30 minutes

* Oracle Configuration
Parameter	Description	Current Value	Impact
oracleCount	Number of configured price oracles	1	More oracles improve security but increase gas costs.
minimumOracleResponses	Minimum number of oracles needed for consensus	1	Higher values increase security but risk function failure if oracles are down.
Governance Considerations:

    Always ensure minimumOracleResponses <= oracleCount
    For critical environments, use at least 3 oracles with minimumOracleResponses = 2
    Adding trustworthy backup oracles is recommended for resilience

 *Rate Limiting (Token Bucket Algorithm)

Each user has a token bucket with the following default parameters:
Parameter	Description	Default Value	Impact
capacity	Maximum tokens a user can hold	5	Higher values allow more transactions in bursts. Range: 3-20 recommended.
refillRate	Tokens added per minute	1	Controls sustained transaction rate. Higher values allow more frequent transactions.
Governance Considerations:

    These can be individually adjusted for specific addresses using updateRateLimitConfig
    For known legitimate high-frequency users, consider values of 10-20 capacity and 2-5 refill rate
    For suspicious accounts, consider reducing to minimum values (1-2 capacity, 0.5 refill rate)

* Governance Security Parameters
Parameter	Description	Current Value	Impact
governanceInactivityThreshold	Time before governance is considered inactive	30 days	Balance between security and practical governance.
governanceExemptionCount	Current number of governance exemptions	2	Limited to prevent excessive exemptions. Max: 5
Governance Considerations:

    governanceInactivityThreshold triggers failsafe mode eligibility
    Keep exemptions minimal to maintain security posture
    Each exemption increases systemic risk but might be necessary for trusted partners

 *System Toggle Parameters
Parameter	Description	Current Value	Impact
isAntibotEnabled	Master switch for all antibot protections	true	When false, disables all protection mechanisms except circuit breakers.
isBuybackPaused	Controls buyback functionality	false	Set automatically based on price impact, can be manually adjusted.
Governance Considerations:

    Only disable isAntibotEnabled temporarily for critical protocol upgrades
    After price stabilization, circuit breakers may need manual reset using resetCircuitBreaker or resetPriceSurgeBreaker

 Performance Impact Guidelines

Parameter adjustments have trade-offs between security, user experience, and gas costs:

    High Security / Low UX: Higher thresholds, longer cooldowns, stricter rate limits
    Low Security / High UX: Lower thresholds, shorter cooldowns, relaxed rate limits

Security Level	Recommended Configuration
Maximum Security	baseMultiplier: 24, rapidTransactionThreshold: 3, capacity: 3, refillRate: 0.5
Balanced	baseMultiplier: 12, rapidTransactionThreshold: 5, capacity: 5, refillRate: 1
User-Friendly	baseMultiplier: 6, rapidTransactionThreshold: 8, capacity: 10, refillRate: 2
 Emergency Response Guide

In case of attack, governance should:

    Verify circuit breaker status via getPriceMonitoringInfo()
    Assess attack pattern via getUserPatternInfo() for suspicious addresses
    Consider sequentially adjusting:
        Reduce capacity and refillRate for affected addresses
        Increase baseMultiplier for stronger throttling
        Decrease rapidTransactionThreshold to trigger throttling sooner
        Activate manual circuit breaker if necessary

Critical Parameter Changes During Attacks
Attack Type	Parameter Adjustments
Sandwich Attack	Increase baseMultiplier (24-36), reduce rapidTransactionThreshold (2-3)
Flash Loan	Lower priceImpactThreshold (2-3%), increase circuitBreakerThreshold (20-25%)
Wash Trading	Reduce default capacity to 3, refillRate to 0.5
Leveraged Position	Increase surgeCooldownPeriod to 60-120 minutes
 Governance Procedure for Parameter Updates

    Analysis: Document current parameter values and market conditions
    Proposal: Specify exact new parameter values with justification
    Impact Assessment: Evaluate potential effects on legitimate users
    Implementation: Execute parameter changes with appropriate timelock
    Monitoring: Observe system behavior for 24-48 hours after changes

Governance participants should maintain these values within safe ranges while adapting to changing market conditions and threat landscapes.
